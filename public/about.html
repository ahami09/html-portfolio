<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a novice web developer reigning from the great Houston, TX that is transitioning from the education field into tech. 
  I had been seeking a career field that I could utilize my past skills & also learn, grow, & refine new ones. I was searching 
  for my passion, going through the motions unhappy in my career until one day I took a coding course that was advertised on 
  facebook, & from there I became really intrigued & hooked. I started to research software developing & watched quite a few 
  webinars to see if this was something I really wanted to do. I was beyond fascinated & I knew that I had never been this excited 
  to learn a new skill that could completely transform my life. 
  </p>

<p>I was looking for something that had flexibility, a lucrative salary, & opportunites for advancement. I had been been
  teaching for the past 8yrs, building relationships, mentoring, & guiding the youth. I enjoyed teaching, but I knew that
something was still missing in my life. That drive & passion was long gone after feeling burnt out. Ever since I started 
learning how to code, I haven't felt more happier. Seeing the projects that I can create continously motivates me. </p>

<p>I am a risk taker, fast learner, & I have gained so many transferrable skills througout the years that I can use to 
  excel in the tech field. I'm ready to take on this journey of a web developer & create some dope projects! I eventually 
  want to help educate others & help more people of color get into software development.
