<h1>The Best Movies According to Amber</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>"They Cloned Tyrone"</h3>
<p>This movie was very deep & had multiple messages that made you really think beyond the surface level. It was also hilarious because it was starring Jamie Fox. Here's one of his funny lines:</p>
<h4>"You know what? That's why I named you Yo-Yo, because you always come right back."</h4>

<h3>"The Woman King"</h3>
<p>This was a great movie because of all of the action & seeing women be the warriors wasn't the typical plot. Here's a quote from the movie:</p>
<h4>"Fighting is not magic. It is a skill"</h4>

<h3>"Waiting to Exhale"</h3>
<p>I loved the sisterhood of this movie & the acting & soundtrack was impeccable. The song "Count on Me" by Whitney Houston was one of my favorite songs from the movie. Here's a few of the lyrics:</p>
<p> 
<h4>Count on me through thick & thin<br />
A friendship that will never end<br />
When you are weak I will be strong<br />
Helping you to carry on<br />
